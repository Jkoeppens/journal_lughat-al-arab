This digital edition of Anastās Mārī al-Karmalī's monthly journal *Lughat al-ʿArab* (Baghdad, 1911--) is part of and follows the principles of [Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE)](https://openarabicpe.github.io) that were originally developped in the context of [Digital Muqtabas](https://github.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas). Full text of this edition has been transcribed by the anonymous transcribers at [*al-maktaba al-shamela*](http://shamela.ws/index.php/book/36540). Digital imagery is available from [*arshīf al-majallāt ...*](http://archive.sakhrit.co/newmagazineYears.aspx?MID=14).

We have not yet added any page breaks to link the digital text and the digital facsimiles, but a first cursory check indicates that the page breaks from *al-maktaba al-shamela* correspond to the printed copy. We have added publication dates for the first three volumes based on the physical copy at the Orient-Institut Beirut's library.

If you just want to browse the edition in a more human-readable view, start [here](https://openarabicpe.github.io/journal_lughat-al-arab/xml/oclc_472450345-i_1.TEIP5.xml) and be reminded that facsimiles have not yet been added beyond the first volume and that, due to HathiTrust's scanning habits, page breaks might not yet link to the correct facsimile. All bibliographic metadata is available as part of [OpenArabicPE's public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/904125/openarabicpe/items/).
